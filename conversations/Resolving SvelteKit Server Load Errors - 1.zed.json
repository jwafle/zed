You might be expecting an export that either has been renamed or isn’t there because your version of SvelteKit doesn’t generate it.\n\n• How to resolve:\n  – Verify that you’re using the correct type for a server load function. With recent versions of SvelteKit, the type for server load functions might be called ServerLoad or something similar.\n  – Instead of importing PageServerLoad from './$types', try importing the type from SvelteKit’s kit package. For example:\n\n   import type { ServerLoad } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n\n  – Then update your function signature accordingly:\n \n   export const load: ServerLoad = async ({ locals }) => {\n    // ...\n   };\n\n  – Alternatively, if you want or need to use PageServerLoad, check that your generated $types file (or your SvelteKit version) supports that export. Sometimes a full restart of your development server or updating SvelteKit can regenerate the correct type definitions.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. \"Binding element 'supabase' implicitly has an 'any' type.\"\n\n• Explanation:\n  – When you destructure the locals object (e.g. { supabase }) from the event parameter of your load function, TypeScript is complaining because it does not know what type supabase is.\n  – This can occur if you haven’t given an explicit type for the locals property. In SvelteKit, you might enhance the locals object in hooks but TypeScript then requires a declaration of its shape.\n\n• How to resolve:\n  – You need to annotate the type for locals (or the supabase property). For example, if you have a SupabaseClient type imported from your Supabase library, you could create a custom type:\n \n   import type { SupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\n \n   interface Locals {\n    supabase: SupabaseClient;\n   }\n\n  – Then, in your load function you can destructure locals with a type annotation:\n \n   export const load: ServerLoad = async ({ locals }: { locals: Locals }) => {\n    const { supabase } = locals;\n    const { data: reading_plans } = await supabase.from('reading_plans').select('*');\n    return { reading_plans: reading_plans ?? [] };\n   };\n\n  – This tells TypeScript what type supabase has and removes the \"implicitly any\" error.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary:\n• For the first error, either update your import to use the correct type from '@sveltejs/kit' (or adjust your $types file) so that the type exists.\n• For the second error, provide an explicit type annotation for the destructured supabase value (or for locals) so that TypeScript knows its type.\n\nAfter these changes, the errors should be resolved.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":37}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":662,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":38}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":29},"start":3989,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":39}}}],"summary":"Resolving SvelteKit Server Load Errors","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":615},"icon":"Warning","label":"Diagnostics: 2 errors","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":15,"end":614},"icon":"File","label":"bible-reading-tracker/src/routes/+page.server.ts","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":64,"end":275},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Module '\"./$types\"' has no exported member 'PageServerLoad'.","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":276,"end":614},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Binding element 'supabase' implicitly has an 'any' type.","metadata":null}]}
